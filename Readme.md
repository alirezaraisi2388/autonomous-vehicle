## Traffic Sign & Lane Detection Prototype

This project is an **initial prototype** for a **Traffic Sign and Lane Detection System** using computer vision techniques.
The main goal of this version is to **test and validate** basic detection algorithms before extending it into a full **autonomous driving module**.

### üîç Features

**Traffic Sign Recognition** ‚Äî powered by a trained CNN model
 **Lane Detection** ‚Äî implemented using OpenCV-based image processing

This prototype serves as a **foundation for future improvements** and integration into **autonomous driving systems**.
